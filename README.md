# Customer-Churn-prediction-with-Machine-Learning
This is a project on the prediction of customer churn of a Bank using machine learning models
 AIM OF ANALYSIS

 The aim of this analysis is to predict the amount of customer churning in a bank using machine learning models

 PROBLEM STATEMENT

 Customer churn or customer defection is the amount of customers that stopped using your company's
 Products or services during a certain time frame.

 IMPORTANCE OF CUSTOMER CHURN DETECTION
•	It cost more to acquire new customers than it is to retain existing customers
•	An increase in customer retention can create an increase in profit
•	It helps businesses understand why customers don't return for repeat business
•	Customer Churn analysis tells you the customers that leave and predicts the particular time

 INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
•	From the prediction models Random forest classifier had the best predictions, closest to the actual    value with an error 0f 2%
•	The random forest classifier is a very accurate model for this prediction and can be used to predict future churns
•	The bank should communicate more with their customers as early as possible to know if they have any problems that can be fixed immediately
•	The bank should focus more on their old customers by giving them incentives before they think of churning.
•	Predict customers that are liable to churn quickly and the time it will occur so preemptive measures can be taken.
